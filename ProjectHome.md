# What is Dalculator #
Dalculator is, as said, a simple easy-to-use calculator program.
When creating Dalculator the aim was to make it simple and intuitive in its use,
while not limiting the user in what he wants to do.
This resulted in a calculator where you can simply type your calculation (like you do in a spreadsheet program) and it will be calculated for you.
